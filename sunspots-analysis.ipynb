This lends the phenomenon naturally to a time series analysis problem. Sunspots are measured using both ground-based and orbitting solar telescopes. Observing and studying sunspots presents an excellent window into understanding solar (and hence stellar) physics, particularly the solar cycle. The solar cycle is a roughly 11-year cycle of solar activity characterized by changes in the magnetic field activity generated by the sun. Sunspots are regions of high concentrations of magnetic field on the sun's surface, and are cooler in temperature compared to their surroundings. Rising solar activity is associated with the outburst of energetic particles outward from the sun which affects the Earth's upper atmosphere, making sensitive instruments in space vulnerable to damage. Moreover, solar activity also possibly affects terrestrial climate. Studying the time variation of sunspot numbers provides a cheap and easy way to continuously monitor, understand and predict the various effects of the solar cycle.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will perform the following tasks:\n\n1. Clean and prepare the data for exploratory data analysis\n\n2. Use plots (line and data points) to show seasonality, local maxima and minima in sunspot numbers over the years.\n\n3. Using boxplots, show that sunspot numbers do not vary much around minima but fluctuate more as solar activity increases. Show that the interquartile range itself displays seasonality and coincides with the solar cycle.\n\n4. Use lag plots and autocorrelation plots to show that the data is not random and possesses strong seasonality. We recover the well-known solar cycle of around 11 years. We also show the presence of a weaker season of around 120 years.\n\n5. Remove jitters in the original data and present a much cleaner moving average plot. This recovers the well-known Dalton Minimum period from 1790 to 1820 of low solar activity.\n\n6. Visually show the asymmetry between rises and falls in solar activity - the time taken to go from a minimum to a maximum tends to be shorter than the one taken to go from the same maximum to the next minimum.\n\n7. Use a heatmap to concisely visualize solar activity over the years, and recover the solar cycle and the longer season of 120 years.\n\n8. Collect all the maxima and find the consecutive time differences between them to recover the solar cycle as the mean of a normal distribution. Show, using a quantile-quantile plot, that the distribution roughly follows a normal curve.\n\n9.
